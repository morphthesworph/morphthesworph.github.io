        <h1>What is this?</h1>
        <p>As any good socialite, I find myself with the desire to advertise myself, yet also find myself in the common situation of not being bothered enough to trudge through the murk that is LinkedIn or to spend the time to create a resume. I have therefore taken it upon myself to create a Github page. Here I will Pseudo-blog psuedo-other things like projects I'm working on and soforth (I honestly have no idea what I want out of this).</p>
        <h1>Why "morphthesworph"?</h1>
        <p>While I hope some people had their neurons activated by the name, Morph the Sworph is a reference to my favorite band of all time: Grailknights. During concerts in the intermissions, the evil Dr. Skull's Igor-esque partner, Morph (the Sworph), will unleash the dragon Urks onto our titular heroes for them to defeat. In my humble opinion, I think Grailknights as a whole is a masterpiece, both of the lyrical and symphonic variety. I think Malt (there might be an e here, I can never remember if its Malte or Malt, as the entire band goes by stage names) Stark's and Tilman Eckelt's talent for songwriting is unparalleled to none other than maybe Christopher Bowes.</p>
